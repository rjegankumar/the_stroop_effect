# Hypothesis testing of the Stroop effect

![](proj_img.png)

The [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect#Stroop_test) named after John Ridley Stroop, an American psychologist, is a demonstration of increased reaction time when test subjects are presented with incongruent words. An example of an incongruent word - word red colored in blue, and the test subject has to name the color of the word. In this project, I performed a hypothesis test of the Stroop effect based on a small sample data of the reaction times of congruent and incongruent words.
